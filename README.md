Description
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Browse here, and find the flag!

javascript:(function() {
            var encryptedFlag = "àÒÆÞ¦È¬ëÙ£ÖÓÚåÛÑ¢ÕÓÔÅÐÙí";
            var key = "picoctf";
            var decryptedFlag = "";
            for (var i = 0; i < encryptedFlag.length; i++) {
                decryptedFlag += String.fromCharCode((encryptedFlag.charCodeAt(i) - key.charCodeAt(i % key.length) + 256) % 256);
            }
            alert(decryptedFlag);
        })();

just make a bookmark 
paste the js code in the url while editing the bookamrk and just open in the new tab


Ref how does a bookmarklet work

To execute JavaScript using a bookmarklet, follow these steps:

Create a Bookmark: First, create a new bookmark in your web browser. You can do this by right-clicking on the bookmarks bar or the bookmarks menu and selecting "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark."

Edit the Bookmark: Once you've created the bookmark, edit its properties. Give it a name that describes what the bookmarklet does.

Paste JavaScript Code: In the URL or Address field of the bookmark, delete the existing URL and paste your JavaScript code instead. Make sure the JavaScript code is preceded by javascript:. This tells the browser that the content of the bookmark is JavaScript code.

Save the Bookmark: Save the bookmark with the changes you've made.

Execute the Bookmarklet: Whenever you want to execute the JavaScript code, simply click on the bookmarklet you've created. This will execute the JavaScript code on the current web page.

Here's an example of how your bookmarklet might look:

css
Copy code
Name: Execute JavaScript
URL: javascript:(function() { /* Your JavaScript code here */ })();
Replace /* Your JavaScript code here */ with the actual JavaScript code you want to execute. Remember to keep the code concise and URL-safe, as there may be limitations on the length of URLs depending on the browser.

Keep in mind that bookmarklets execute JavaScript in the context of the current web page, so they can interact with the DOM and perform various actions on the page. However, due to security restrictions, they may have limited access to certain features depending on the browser's security policies.

 Chall name - Super SSH
AUTHOR: JEFFERY JOHN

Description
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 49566 to get the flag?
You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell


ssh  ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p  49566
The authenticity of host '[titan.picoctf.net]:49566 ([3.139.174.234]:49566)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Note: switching to 'b562f0b425907789d11d2fe2793e67592dc6be93'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at b562f0b create flag

Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!
You can download the challenge files here:
